# Misconception Cards (MC)
- MC-1: "If two events are simultaneous in one frame, they are simultaneous for all." → Counter: simultaneity is frame-dependent; causal class is invariant.
- MC-2: "Space-like means faster-than-light motion." → Counter: it means no causal connection within c.
- MC-3: "Proper time equals classroom/clock time." → Counter: proper time is along a specific worldline.
