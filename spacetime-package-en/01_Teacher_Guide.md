# Teacher Guide

**Purpose.** Use spacetime geometry as a narrative to connect physics concepts (light cones, worldlines, proper time, geodesics)
with reflective questions about identity and causal responsibility.

## Learning Objectives (condensed)
- Explain light cones as causal maps and classify time-like / light-like / space-like separations.
- Read and narrate worldlines: slope → speed; curvature → acceleration.
- Describe proper time as the time accumulated along one's own worldline; relate to the twin paradox.
- Interpret a spacelike slice Σ as a frame-dependent "now" without positing absolute simultaneity.
- Build short, causally consistent narratives from a spacetime diagram and argue about limits of knowledge & agency.

## Facilitation Tips
- Anchor every new term with a plain-language definition and a diagram.
- Always ask: *What signals could connect these events?* to reinforce causal thinking.
- Prefer qualitative reasoning; no equations are required.
- Encourage short reflective writing to bridge physics → meaning.
